# sopp-analyzer-final

Here you will find the sopp parser parser.rb.  This is meant to parse 5 specific files from the stanford open policing project.  

It generates 5 output files, 3 of them are looking at specific data with reference to race and outcomes, race and age, and race and gender.  The files which did have the information I was looking for in these categories did not have violations reported.  Therefore I also went back and added Chicago and Mt State Trooper data to ensure I had completed the assignment as intended.  The last two files are the violations breakdown report for Chicago and Mt State respectively.
